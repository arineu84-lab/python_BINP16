    "    The task is to produce a haplotype map for mtDNA and Y mutations. For this, SNPs need to be identified from the different input files with different individuals providing their genetic material. Next, major and minor alleles need to be determined and the minor allele frequency needs to be calculated. The final results will be written in an output file.\n",
