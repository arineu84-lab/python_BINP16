# python_BINP16
Different python script that I created during the python course BINP16 at LU HT25 for different assignments. Some codes were written for group projects. 
The codes are written either in Python Spyder6 (.py) or in Jupyter Notebook via Mac Terminal, creating a new environment and running the notebook on the browser (.ipynb).
